# Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) - Java

## Project Description -    
In Revature's Social Network everyone is friends with everyone else. Users can register, login to the application, and start sharing multimedia with everyone. Registered users are allowed to modify their personal information and upload their profile pictures. The application provides a search feature that allows users to search out friends and look at their profiles. Users are provided with a "feed", in which they can see what everyone is posting and like posts. Users can access and use the application via an interactive client-side single paged application that stores and retrieves multimedia using AWS S3 and consumes a RESTful web service that provides business logic and access to a database.
